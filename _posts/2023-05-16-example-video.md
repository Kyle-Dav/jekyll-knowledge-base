This is an example video that shows off how videos can be displayed and utilized in this knowledge base.

## Justification

Videos are an awesome way to communicate information because they do not interrupt the flow of your message and help people to remember a message better. People typically prefer watching short videos rather than reading long ones, since people cannot hold their attention for more than 5 seconds. Short videos are always available on websites, videos shared on Facebook, and videos on Twitter and LinkedIn. You can also create video content with a digital camera. In short, creating videos is an easy way to reach your audience.
